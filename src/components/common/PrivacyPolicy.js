With these functions, Facebook is able to target our visitors for the presentation of advertisements, so-called "Facebook Ads". Accordingly, we use Facebook Re / Marketing features to display the Facebook Ads we submit only to Facebook users as well as those Facebook users who might be interested in similar features (so-called "Lookalike Audiences"). This helps in keeping the Facebook Ads in line with the potential interest of users and are not annoying. We can also track the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by seeing if users have been redirected to our site after clicking on a Facebook ad.</span></span></p>
